# Gesture_Control
A project to enable control of appliances through gestures.
the master branch contains all the different methods we tried to achieve gesture control of a media player on a laptop or a desktop PC. the one that works optimally in all test conditions is the Mixture of Gaussian background subtraction and subsequent foreground feature extraction. 
## caution:
this is still a work in progress. production level performance should not be expected. Thank You.
## development:
1. clone this repository or download as zip.
2. make sure you have python 3.6.9 or above installed and also opencv version '4.1.0' or above installed.
3. the files of concern are simple.py and action_maker.py.
4. other python files contain alternate methods to achieve gesture control.
5. play around, add your own approach
